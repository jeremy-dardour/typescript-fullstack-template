# CLAUDE.md

Production-ready fullstack monorepo template: NestJS API + React SPA + shared tooling.

See [README.md](./README.md) for project overview, setup, and CI pipeline.

## Documentation map

Project knowledge — one home per fact. Read these to get oriented (rationale in
[ADR 0005](./docs/adr/0005-documentation-context-structure.md)):

| Doc                                                    | Holds                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [docs/project-purpose.md](./docs/project-purpose.md)   | Why the project exists, who it's for, scope boundaries              |
| [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md)                             | Domain glossary — entities, statuses, rules                         |
| [docs/domain-decisions.md](./docs/domain-decisions.md) | Domain/design decisions + rationale (append-only)                   |
| [docs/current-state.md](./docs/current-state.md)       | The live "where we are" — phase, status, next steps, open questions |
| [docs/sessions/](./docs/sessions/)                     | One dated summary per session (what was done, learnings, status)    |
| [docs/adr/](./docs/adr/)                               | Technical/architectural decisions                                   |

**Always loaded at session start** (imported so they're in context from the start):

@docs/project-purpose.md
@CONTEXT.md
@docs/current-state.md

Documentation conventions:

- **Project memory lives in-repo** (the docs above). Do **not** create external
  memory files for this project — record durable project facts here instead.
- **Single home per fact.** Live status lives only in `current-state.md`; domain
  decisions only in `docs/domain-decisions.md`; session files record what
  happened + learnings and link out rather than restating current truth.
- **Session summaries.** When logging or closing a session, add a summary in
  `docs/sessions/` using the template and instructions there
  ([docs/sessions/README.md](./docs/sessions/README.md)). Update
  `current-state.md` at session end.

## Monorepo structure

```
apps/
  api/          → NestJS REST API
  web/          → React SPA
packages/
  api-contracts/  → OpenAPI-generated TypeScript types
  eslint-config/  → Shared ESLint flat config
  shared/         → Shared utilities
  typescript-config/ → Shared tsconfig presets
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                        # Start all apps
pnpm check-types                # TypeScript type checking
pnpm lint                       # ESLint
pnpm test                       # Unit tests
pnpm --filter api test:e2e      # API E2E tests
pnpm --filter web test:e2e      # Web E2E tests
pnpm generate:api-types         # Regenerate OpenAPI types from running API
```

## Standards

See [Global standards](./STANDARDS.md) — TypeScript, imports, naming, testing basics
See [API standards](./apps/api/STANDARDS.md) — entities, modules, DTOs, architecture boundaries
See [Web standards](./apps/web/STANDARDS.md) — components, hooks, API layer, auth, i18n

## Decisions

Architectural trade-offs live in [docs/adr/](./docs/adr/) as compact ADRs
(migrations at container start, zod vs class-validator split, trust proxy).
Consult them before "fixing" what they document; record new decisions of that
kind as the next numbered ADR.

## Workflow

- Before declaring work done: `pnpm check-types && pnpm lint && pnpm test`
- After changing entities or endpoints: regenerate migration / API types (see
  [apps/api/README.md](./apps/api/README.md)); never hand-edit
  `packages/api-contracts/src/openapi.d.ts`
